# Malware Sample 2 – Analysis Summary

This sample is a malicious PDF document delivered via phishing. It contains an embedded URL that, when accessed, retrieves and executes secondary payloads. The malware does not rely on macros or embedded scripts but exploits potential vulnerabilities in the PDF reader environment.

## Key Behaviors
- Attempts to connect to external URL: hxxps://afarm.net/uxz1b
- Downloads and executes secondary payloads, including executables and DLLs
- Drops multiple malicious files (202 observed in sandbox analysis)
- Initiates command-and-control traffic over HTTP/HTTPS, possibly using encrypted channels

## Indicators of Compromise (IOC) Selection
Sandbox analysis generated numerous network connections and dropped files.
Only high-confidence, actionable indicators directly related to payload delivery
and command-and-control infrastructure were retained.

## Impact
Medium to High risk. Can lead to remote code execution and system compromise if the PDF is opened in a vulnerable environment. Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary code and install additional malware.

## Mitigation Recommendations
- Do not open suspicious PDFs 
- Block identified malicious domains and IPs
- Keep PDF reader up to date 
- Train users to avoid opening unsolicited attachments
