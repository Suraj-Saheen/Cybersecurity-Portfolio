## File Information
- **File Name:** may-document_71837433.pdf
- **File Type:** PDF document, version 1.3, 1 page(s)
- **SHA256:** 0b9b240c69ba1cd5c06b160021798f3b0ddfd855aad6fd6aeda421a79341b7f4

## Detection Summary
- 28 / 63 security vendors flagged this file as malicious
- **Malware Type:** phishing trojan
- **Malware Family:** darkgate


## Static Analysis
- Entropy = 7.808501 bits per byte.
- URL found inside PDF: `hxxps[://]afarm[.]net/uxz1b` 
- Domain `afarm.net` flagged by 10/93 security vendors 
- Likely used for malicious redirection or downloader functionality 
- Do not access the URL directly — treat as unsafe


**Static analysis was performed on `may-document_71837433.pdf` using PDFiD (v0.2.10).**
**No suspicious PDF elements were found:**

- `/JS` and `/JavaScript`: 0 (no embedded scripts)
- `/OpenAction` and `/AA`: 0 (no automatic actions)
- `/AcroForm`: 0 (no interactive forms)
- `/Launch`: 0 (does not try to launch programs)
- `/EmbeddedFile`: 0 (no embedded files)

**Conclusion:** The PDF contains no active scripts or auto-executing elements, indicating that any potential malicious behavior is likely dependent on a vulnerable PDF reader environment. Static analysis shows it is structurally clean.

## Dynamic Analysis (Sandbox)
- Execution initiated via URL found inside PDF: `hxxps[://]afarm[.]net/uxz1b`
- Remote document fetched from external server
- Secondary payload downloaded and executed
- Dropped multiple files including executable payloads

## Dropped Malicious Files
- Binary.AdobeIsf (Win32 DLL)
- ADelRCP (Win32 DLL)
- Total 202 files are dropped which is not possible to list them all here, check virutotal website with the sha256 hash value to get all the details.
