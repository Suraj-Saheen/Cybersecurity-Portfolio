# Malware Sample 3 – Analysis Summary

This sample is a malicious executable (FormBook trojan) that collects credentials, performs system reconnaissance, and communicates with remote command-and-control servers. It uses various evasion and persistence techniques to avoid detection and maintain long-term access.

## Key Behaviors
- Captures user input and clipboard data (keylogging and sensitive info theft)
- Dumps system credentials and passwords from the OS
- Performs system and process discovery, as well as software and file enumeration
- Downloads and executes additional malicious payloads
- Initiates command-and-control communication over HTTP/HTTPS

## Indicators of Compromise (IOC) Selection
Sandbox analysis generated numerous network connections and dropped files.
Only high-confidence, actionable indicators directly related to payload delivery
and command-and-control infrastructure were retained.

## Impact
High risk. Successful execution allows attackers to exfiltrate credentials, monitor user activity, execute arbitrary code, and compromise the host system.

## Mitigation Recommendations
- Block identified malicious domains and IPs
- Use endpoint protection with behavior-based detection
- Monitor for abnormal process creation and network connections
- Educate users against opening unsolicited executables or links
