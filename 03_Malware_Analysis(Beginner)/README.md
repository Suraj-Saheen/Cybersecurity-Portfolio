# Malware Analysis – Beginner Project

## Project Overview
This project documents the analysis of three malware samples using safe malware analysis techniques on an Ubuntu Linux environment. The goal is to understand malware behavior through static and dynamic analysis while maintaining system security.

Each malware sample is analyzed independently and documented in its own directory.


## Analysis Environment

- **Host OS:** Ubuntu Linux
- **Analysis Method:** Virtualized & sandbox-based analysis
- **Safety Measures:**
  - Malware handled only inside isolated environments
  - No execution on host system
  - Network indicators sanitized before documentation


## Tools Used

- **VirusTotal** (hash and reputation analysis)
- **Any.Run** (interactive dynamic analysis sandbox)
- **Linux command-line tools:**
  - `sha256sum`,`sha1sum`, `md5sum`
  - `strings`
  - `file`
  - `ent`

## Malware Samples Analyzed

|  Sample  |  Malware Type |            Key Focus             |
|:--------:|:-------------:|:--------------------------------:|
| Sample 1 | Trojan Downloader | Exploting CVE-2017-0199, Scheduled Task/Job, Persistence & C2 communication   |
| Sample 2 |  Phishing Trojan    | Phishing, Spearphishing Link & Encrypted Channel C2 Communication           |
| Sample 3 | Trojan     |  Hijack Execution Flow, Input Capture, OS Credential Dumping,  Clipboard Data & Encrypted Channel C2 Communication        |

**Each sample directory includes:**
- File hashes
- Static & dynamic behavior analysis
- Extracted network IOCs
- Risk assessment & mitigation steps

## Skills Demonstrated

- Linux-based malware analysis
- Static analysis using command-line tools
- Sandbox-based dynamic analysis
- Indicator of Compromise (IOC) extraction
- Malware documentation and reporting
- Security mitigation planning


## Disclaimer
This project is for **educational purposes only**.

Prepared as part of a cybersecurity learning portfolio using Ubuntu Linux.

All malware samples were obtained from public malware repositories and analyzed in isolated environments. No malware was executed on the host Ubuntu system.
