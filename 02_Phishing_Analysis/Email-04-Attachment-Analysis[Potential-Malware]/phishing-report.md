Description
======================================
This email is a suspected phishing email impersonating "protonmail.com" ( a popular, privacy-focused email service based in Switzerland ), claiming to relate to a due invoice payment was received and analyzed. The email contains an attachment of the quotation with a '.iso' file extension which are universal disk images and are supported across virtually all major operating systems.

Attacker spoofed the mail and pretend to be from "moss.it" but it fails SPF which means the sender server (IP: 213.227.154.65) is not authorized to send mail for "moss.it".
There is no DKIM and DMARC which is very suspicious. Legitimate business invoices almost always use DKIM for integrity.

Moreover the email contains grammatical errors, unstructured and uneven spacing which is abnormal.


Artifact Analysis
======================================
**Sender Analysis:**
The sender fails SPF and there is no cryptographic signature like DKIM and DMARC. Which raises concern.

The IP address(213.227.154.65) used is not associated with "protonmail.com". According to 'whois.com' the IP is associated with "ORG-OB3-RIPE" a Netherland based hosting provider. (whois.com website screenshot provided in 'screenshots' directory).

The sender and bounce domain used 'Paol.Reggiani@moss.it' is spoofed and typo is noticed 'Paol' instead of 'Paolo'.



**Attachment Analysis:**
The attached file "quotation.iso" is downloaded in a sandbox environment and the SHA256, SHA1 and MD5 hash of the file is calculated (The hash values are provided in the attachment section of the report).

.iso files are disk images, often used to bypass antivirus filters and a quotation file with .iso file extension is not common which raises concern.

Upon uploading the SHA256 in VirusTotal, it flagged by multiple engines as Trojan / backdoor(Screenshot of virustotal website is provided in the 'screenshots' directory).


Impact Level
======================================
Critical- This phishing email impersonates a trusted email service provider "protonmail.com" which many business and organization uses daily. The user unaware of the file can run the file which can lead to Credential Capture, Corporate Network Compromise, and even financial loss.


Verdict
======================================
**Confirmed Phishing Email**
The email is not legitimate,impersonating "protonmail.com". A clear indication of domain spoofing and impersonation of legitimate service and platform is detected. Further investigation and checks must be conducted on the attached file(quotation.iso) to check and study the behaviour of the malware.

Defense Actions
======================================
-Block Sending Domain and domains associated with the emails.

-Enforce DMARC = reject

-Report to email provider 'abuse@proton.me' as malicious and phishing.

-Inform the user and if the attachment is opened, immediately isolate the affected system and perform a full malware scan.
